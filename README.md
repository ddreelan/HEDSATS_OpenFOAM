# HEDSATS
High Energy Density Semi-Analytical Thermal Solution library and example applications

Contained within this repository are a series of semi-analytical thermal solutions to heat conduction problems representative of high energy density advanced manufacturing processes.

The solutions utilise various combinations of Laplace transform, Eigen value problem and method of images based solutions to compute the thermal response to volumetric heat sources in orthogonal three dimensional domains.

The relevant works pertaining to this software are:

The software is intended to increase the use of Green's function based thermal analysis techniques in scenarios where their application is appropriate.

Various example applications are included in the release which demonstrate how a user may call the functions in HEDSATS which return the solutions to the 3D transient heat equation with the application of various distributed heat sources.
